Fibonacci sequences appear regularly in nature. For example, the shell of the chambered nautilus grows in accordance with a Fibonacci sequence, as does the generalized growth of a population of rabbits.

A Fibonacci sequence of numbers is composed of elements created by adding the two previous elements. The simplest Fibonacci sequence starts with 1, 1 and proceeds as follows:

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦    However, a Fibonacci sequence can be created with any two starting numbers.

In this lab, i will use if-else statement(s) and loops to generate a Fibonacci sequence and plot results from values entered by the user.  I highly suggest that you use pseudo-code and a flow chart to plan out the operation of your program before you write any code.
